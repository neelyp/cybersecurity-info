    description:
      "Confidentiality keeps data private and only accessible to authorized users. A key component of the confidentiality pillar is that only those with the right permissions can access certain information, keeping unauthorized users out. For example, a healthcare provider must make sure that patient records are accessible to the correct medical staff, but not to anyone else.",

    description:
      "Integrity ensure that all data is the way that it was meant to be. Data integrity means that information has not been altered or tampered with, either by accident or maliciously. For example, if a bank statement is sent to a user, integrity measures would ensure that the statement has not been changed in any way from how the bank generated it originally.",

      "Implement access controls and user permissions",
      "Use checksums and hashes to verify data integrity",

    description:
      "Availability ensures that all data, no matter how sensitive, is accessible to authorized users after necessary security precautions. Protected or not, all data is useless if it cannot be accessed when it is needed. For example, students need to be able to access their grades in the gradebook system when needed, but only after properly logging in.",
    threats: [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that make systems unavailable.",
      "Natural disasters that disrupt access to data centers.",
      "Hardware failures that lead to data loss or unavailability.",
    ],
    safeguards: [
      "Implement redundancy and failover solutions",
      "Implement disaster recovery systems in the event of natural disasters",
      "Use load balancers and content delivery networks (CDNs)",
